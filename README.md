# Hi, I'm Salva ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fullstack developer with ~4 years of experience and tech curious since I was a child.
My career has been centered on web technologies and applications:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 3MT Global Services S.L. as Analyst Programmer.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Java Spring and developing my own projects.

- :loudspeaker:	I speak: spanish, galician, english and italian.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I love nature, photography and painting.
